        <h1>ðŸŸª Reflection & Professional Identity</h1>
        <p>Through writing this report and studying the course, I have progressed from a purely data analysis perspective to a strategic thinking level. At first, I only described financial and market data; as I deepened my understanding of <strong>CSR, DEI, and AI ethics</strong>, I learned to compare practices of different companies, connect theory with cases, and analyze causal relationships.</p>
        <p>At the synthesis stage, I realized that financial performance, social responsibility, and technological innovation are intertwined: Pro Medicus's high profit margin benefits from the SaaS model, which also provides funding for its ESG investment; AI innovation drives clinical value, but must be implemented through ethical governance and a diverse, multicultural team.</p>
        <p>At the evaluation stage, I am able to critically assess corporate successâ€”not only shareholder returns, but also environmental footprint, employee well-being, and patient interests. This upgrade in thinking has prompted me to reposition my career goals: in the future, I hope to promote <strong>responsible innovation</strong> in the medical technology or consulting industry, advocating for sustainable and inclusive industry development.</p>
        <p>The course and report writing have helped me grow from a "<strong>data analyst</strong>" to a "<strong>strategic thinker</strong>". I will continue to deepen my knowledge in AI ethics, ESG transparency, and diversity management, integrate these values into my work, and promote a balance between business success and social responsibility.</p>
